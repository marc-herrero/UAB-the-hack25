## üåü Problem

Many rural and semi-urban communities in Latin America rely on expensive, polluting diesel/oil generators due to unreliable grid access. Transitioning to renewables faces significant challenges:

- **Unclear viability**: Lack of technical expertise to assess renewable potential
- **High upfront costs**: Fear of investing without guaranteed returns
- **Skill gaps**: No local capacity to install/maintain systems
- **Information asymmetry**: Difficulty accessing reliable data and expert analysis

## üí° Solution

SoLatAm is an AI-driven platform that empowers communities to transition to renewables through three integrated components:

### 1. Viability Assessment Tool
- **Interactive Mapping**: Select locations and analyze solar potential with precision
- **Terrain Analysis**: Evaluate slope, aspect, and other geographical features
- **Cost-Benefit Calculator**: Project ROI timelines and compare to fossil fuel costs
- **NASA Data Integration**: Leveraging NASA POWER API for reliable solar irradiance data

### 2. Visual Analysis & AI Assistant
- **Image Recognition**: Upload images of potential installation sites for expert assessment
- **Multilingual Assistant**: Get answers to technical questions in Spanish and other languages
- **Voice Interaction**: Use voice commands for accessibility in low-literacy contexts

### 3. Community Collaboration Hub
- **Knowledge Exchange**: Forums and resource libraries to share experiences
- **Local Workforce Marketplace**: Connect with trained technicians in your area
- **Progress Tracking**: Measure community-wide impact and achievements

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

SoLatAm combines several components:

1. **Data Processing Pipeline**:
   - NASA POWER API integration for solar irradiance data
   - Geographic terrain analysis (slope, aspect calculations)
   - Energy production potential modeling

2. **AI Services**:
   - OpenAI-powered multilingual chatbot
   - Computer vision for solar installation analysis
   - Voice recognition for accessibility

3. **Interactive Interfaces**:
   - Streamlit-based web application
   - Interactive maps with Folium
   - Data visualizations with Matplotlib

## üìä Key Features

### Solar Potential Mapping

Our platform uses advanced algorithms to analyze terrain characteristics, such as slope and aspect, and solar irradiance data to create detailed solar potential maps:
